Sports that are judged on both technical merit and artistic expression are challenging to judge objectively and figure skating is no exception. In 2004, the previous highly subjective figure skating scoring system was replaced with the International Judging System(IJS) which takes into account the minutiae of every skating program awarding a specific point value based on multiple calculations. Following this change, the United States has seen a drastic decrease in international accomplishment for women skaters representing the USA.The recent 2022 Olympic winter games in Beijing marks 4 consecutive Olympics in which the US women have not been awarded a medal. Many critics of the current state of international figure skating suggest that the medal drought is directly related to Russian dominance in women's figure skating. Russian figure skating has been under scrutiny for their questionable training tactics and with a recently doping scandal at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, it's more than reasonable for all other skating federations to reject Russian figure skating training tactics and put the wellbeing of athletes ahead of competitive victories However, can the 15 year medal drought be completed contributed to this?In the four most recent Winter Olympic Games, at least one of the women figure skating medals has gone to an athlete from Japan, South Korea, Italy, or Canada. It's also worth noting that the United States is continuing to excel greatly in most figure skating disciplines (especially mens and ice dancing). This project is a data-driven analysis of this project in which I explore trends that may offer insights to improve US women's figure skating scores at the Olympic Games.Historically, figure skating has been a sport in which the United States has greatly excelled in the Olympic Winter Games.

Sports that are judged on both technical merit and artistic expression are challenging to judge objectively and figure skating is no exception. In 2004, the previous highly subjective figure skating scoring system was replaced with the International Judging System(IJS) which takes into account the minutiae of every skating program awarding a specific point value based on multiple calculations. Following this change, the United States has seen a drastic decrease in international accomplishment for women skaters representing the USA.The recent 2022 Olympic winter games in Beijing marks 4 consecutive Olympics in which the US women have not been awarded a medal. Many critics of the current state of international figure skating suggest that the medal drought is directly related to Russian dominance in women's figure skating. Russian figure skating has been under scrutiny for their questionable training tactics and with a recently doping scandal at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, it's more than reasonable for all other skating federations to reject Russian figure skating training tactics and put the wellbeing of athletes ahead of competitive victories However, can the 15 year medal drought be completed contributed to this?In the four most recent Winter Olympic Games, at least one of the women figure skating medals has gone to an athlete from Japan, South Korea, Italy, or Canada. It's also worth noting that the United States is continuing to excel greatly in most figure skating disciplines (especially mens and ice dancing). This project is a data-driven analysis of this project in which I explore trends that may offer insights to improve US women's figure skating scores at the Olympic Games.Historically, figure skating has been a sport in which the United States has greatly excelled in the Olympic Winter Games.
